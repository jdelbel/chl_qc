This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

#Reducing number of columns to make less complicated. Attempted to search for duplicates, but counts samples collected at same site hours apart as duplicates. This occurred at QU39, 2020-06-22, when then collected samples at different tidal cycles. In theory, the collected times should be different even for duplicates, so could I just separate and merge samples based on collected time rather than date and ignore the duplicate issue for now? Trying with collected to see if there are any duplicated collected times - in itself, these may indicate a data problem (explain, examples: 1) QU39, 2020-03-06, 20m, the GFF sample is missing and; 2) QU39, 2020-05-26, 100m, this sample has the exact same values, so not a duplicate but a double entry likely due to pressure transducer issue and this should be fixed on the portal).

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
